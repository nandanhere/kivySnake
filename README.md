# kivySnake
Snake game  made with Kivy and python
This Repo can be used as an example for replacing pygame with kivy to make certain games. Since pygame does not currently support smartphones , and as Kivy uses OpenGL for graphics which is faster and better in contrast to the pygame engine.
## Features
- Sounds implemented with kivysound
- Store high scores with JsonStore
- Examples of using .kv files with the .py files for each class (some documentation needed here)
